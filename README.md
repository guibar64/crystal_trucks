### End Grid ###

Start!
```

This means that you have:

- 6 trucks
- a 28-cell wide crystals grid
- a 11-cell tall crystals grid
- the crystals grid content, one character per cell
  - space: 0 crystal
  - 1: 1 crystal
  - 2: 2 crystals

You have to provide commands for the trucks. The command syntax is:

```
turn ACTION truck_id arguments
```

where:

- turn is the number of game cycles, each truck can provide a command per turn
- ACTION is the action done by the truck
- truck_id is the index of the truck
- arguments are the arguments of the command

For instance:

```
3 MOVE 1 0 2
```

means that during the third turn, the truck \#1 moves to cell (x=0, y=2).

Below are the possible actions.

### MOVE

```
turn MOVE truck_id cell_x cell_y
```

Moves the truck_id-th truck to cell (x=cell_x, y=cell_y). The truck can go through only one cell at a time. If the target cell is to far away, the truck will advance towards the target cell, but will go through only one cell.

### DIG

```
turn DIG truck_id cell_x cell_y
```

The truck_id-th truck digs the cell (x=cell_x, y=cell_y). If the truck is not on the target cell, the command is ignored. If the truck is on the target cell, and if at least one crystal is present in the cell, then one crystal is collected.
